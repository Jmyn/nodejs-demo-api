## Endpoints
### 1. As a teacher, I want to register one or more students to a specified teacher.
A teacher can register multiple students. A student can also be registered to multiple teachers.

* Endpoint: `POST /api/register`
* Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
* Success response status: HTTP 204
* Request body example:
```
{
  "teacher": "teacherken@gmail.com"
  "students":
    [
      "studentjon@example.com",
      "studenthon@example.com"
    ]
}
```

### 2. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students common to a given list of teachers (i.e. retrieve students who are registered to ALL of the given teachers).

* Endpoint: `GET /api/commonstudents`
* Success response status: HTTP 200
* Request example 1: `GET /api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40example.com`
* Success response body 1:
```
{
  "students" :
    [
      "commonstudent1@gmail.com", 
      "commonstudent2@gmail.com",
      "student_only_under_teacher_ken@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```
* Request example 2: `GET /api/commonstudents?teacher=teacherken%40example.com&teacher=teacherjoe%40example.com`
* Success response body 2:
```
{
  "students" :
    [
      "commonstudent1@gmail.com", 
      "commonstudent2@gmail.com"
    ]
}
```

### 3. As a teacher, I want to suspend a specified student.

* Endpoint: `POST /api/suspend`
* Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
* Success response status: HTTP 204
* Request body example:
```
{
  "student" : "studentmary@gmail.com"
}
```

### 4. As a teacher, I want to retrieve a list of students who can receive a given notification.
A notification consists of:
* the teacher who is sending the notification, and
* the text of the notification itself.

To receive notifications from e.g. 'teacherken@example.com', a student:
* MUST NOT be suspended,
* AND MUST fulfill *AT LEAST ONE* of the following:
    1. is registered with “teacherken@example.com"
    2. has been @mentioned in the notification

The list of students retrieved should not contain any duplicates/repetitions.

* Endpoint: `POST /api/retrievefornotifications`
* Headers: `Content-Type: application/json`
* Success response status: HTTP 200
* Request body example 1:
```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@example.com",
  "notification": "Hello students! @studentagnes@example.com @studentmiche@example.com"
}
```
* Success response body 1:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@example.com",
      "studentagnes@example.com", 
      "studentmiche@example.com"
    ]   
}
```
In the example above, studentagnes@example.com and studentmiche@example.com can receive the notification from teacherken@example.com, regardless whether they are registered to him, because they are @mentioned in the notification text. studentbob@example.com however, has to be registered to teacherken@example.com.
* Request body example 2:
```
{
  "teacher":  "teacherken@example.com",
  "notification": "Hey everybody"
}
```
* Success response body 2:
```
{
  "recipients":
    [
      "studentbob@example.com",
    ]   
}
```
